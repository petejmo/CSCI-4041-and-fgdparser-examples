# CSCI-4041-and-fgdparser-examples
CSCI4041 project 2 and Comp Ling sample files

#RuleMaker2 and questionbank files are part of the fgdparser project. 
This project takes a corpus of parsed question trees and reverse engineers the grammatical rules of questions. 
Then it processes new questions based off those rules and returns their trees. 
The project is incomplete because it was a group project and I've included only the sections I wrote, 
but those sections (RuleMaker2 specifically) should be clear enough to give the general idea of the algorithm.
